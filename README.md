<h1>Shopify_ImageRepository</h1>
<p>
  Built a simple image repository web application that allows users to add
  images to the repository, to share their favourite photos or memories with the
  internet.
</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>
  This was the Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question for Winter 2020. I
  thought the project idea of building an image repository was very interesting
  but to make it more interesting, I added the constraint to use Ruby on Rails
  as the backend to mimic Shopify’s tech stack.
